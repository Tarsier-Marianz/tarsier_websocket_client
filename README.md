**Tarsier WebSocket Client** is a Dart package for managing WebSocket connections and real-time event handling. It is designed to be compatible with the Pusher WebSocket protocol used by [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/). This package extends the functionality of the `pusher_client` package to support the *Windows platform*, while maintaining compatibility with other platforms.

This package has been tested with [Laravel WebSockets](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction). Although not explicitly tested with Pusher.com, it is expected to work with Pusher due to protocol compatibility.

## ‚ú® Features
- **WebSocket Connection Management**: Connect, disconnect, and manage state seamlessly.
- **Channel Types**:
    - `Public Channels`: Basic channels without authentication.
    - `Private Channels`: Secure channels requiring authentication.
    - `Presence Channels`: Channels for tracking online users and presence data.
    - `Private Encrypted Channels`: Secure and encrypted channels for sensitive data.
- **Event Handling**: Bind, unbind, and handle custom events.
- **Authentication**: Secure private and presence channels with authentication options.
- **Encryption**: Support for encrypted channels using SecretBox for secure communication.
- **Windows Platform Support**: Extends the pusher_client package to work on Windows
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with configurable retry attempts and intervals.
- **Logging**: Configurable logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Disclaimer
This package is designed to work with the Pusher WebSocket protocol. It has been thoroughly tested with [Laravel WebSockets](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction) but not explicitly with the official [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/) service. If it works with [Laravel WebSockets](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction), it is likely to work with [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/) due to protocol compatibility. Feedback from developers testing it with Pusher.com is highly appreciated.

## üöÄ Installation
Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  tarsier_websocket_client: ^1.0.0
```
Install it by running:
```sh
flutter pub get
```
Import it in your Dart code:
```dart
import 'package:tarsier_websocket_client/tarsier_websocket_client.dart';
```

## üìí Usage
- **Basic Setup**
    
    Here's an example of setting up and using the Tarsier WebSocket Client:

```dart
import 'package:tarsier_websocket_client/tarsier_websocket_client.dart';

void main() {
  final client = TarsierWebsocketClient(
    options: PusherOptions(
      key: 'your-app-key',
      authOptions: PusherAuthOptions(
        endpoint: 'https://example.com/auth',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token',
        },
      ),
    ),
  );

  // Log event when there's an error on connection
  client.onConnectionError((error) {
    print("Connection error: $error");
  });
  client.onError((error) {
    print("Error: $error");
  });
  client.onDisconnected((data) {
    print("Disconnected: $data");
  });

  // Connect to the WebSocket server
  client.connect();

  // Subscribe to a public channel
  final channel = client.subscribe<Channel>('my-channel');
  channel.bind('my-event', (data) {
    print('Event received: $data');
  });

  // Subscribe to a private channel
  final privateChannel = client.private('private-my-channel');
  privateChannel.bind('my-private-event', (data) {
    print('Private event received: $data');
  });

  // Disconnect when done
  client.disconnect();
}
```
- **Presence Channel Example**
```dart
final presenceChannel = client.presence('presence-my-channel');
presenceChannel.bind('user-joined', (data) {
  print('A new user joined: $data');
});
```
- **Logging**

Enable logging for debugging:
```dart
final client = TarsierWebsocketClient(
  options: PusherOptions(
    key: 'your-app-key',
    enableLogging: true, //Set to true if you want to enable logging
    authOptions: PusherAuthOptions(endpoint: 'https://example.com/auth'),
  ),
);
```
